# 3D-O-Matic-GUI alias "Marlinterface"
A simple graphical host in Python3 intended for 
Marlin 3D-printer controllers.
Compared to much complexer projects like Printrun / Pronterface this GUI may provide an easier
base for learning how the interaction between
host and printer is working.
Requires tkinter, ThemedTk and themed_style.
In Marlin 2.0 ADVANCED_OK must be set.

Suggestions, improvements and comments welcome!
