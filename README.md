# 3D-O-Matic-GUI alias "Marlinterface"
A simple graphical client in Python3 intended for 
Marlin 3D-printer controllers.
Compared to much complexer projects like Printrun
or Pronterface this GUI may provide an easier
base for learning how the interaction between
host and printer is working.
Requires tkinter, ThemedTk and themed_style.
Suggestions, improvements and comments welcome!
